Weekly Project Report

Week ending October 1 (week 5)

Progress:
This week we completed the coding that converts the nutritional data from per 100gm to whatever is called for in the recipe.  For example, if a recipe calls for 1 tsp of salt the app will calculate the nutritional data (sodium) for 1 tsp rather than for 100 gms.  We also added several more nutrients (sugar, fat) to the print-out and all recipe data is now compiled in a single list. For this list, each separate ingredient with its nutritional data is embedded as a list within the list.  The correctly calculated nutritional data was the goal of this sprint.

Next sprint:
This is a two-week sprint with an end date of 10/15.  The main goal for this sprint is to get a GUI up-and-running.  Currently, we are using Visual Studio to create the GUI.  This uses C#, so the Python code will need to be re-written/ converted.  The GUI will include a drop-down for measurement unit (i.e.- tsp, cup, tbsp) and buttons for the "more ingredients?" variable.  Additional goals for this sprint include adding calculator for ingredients given in ounces (oz.) and adding calculator to account for serving size.  This sprint was crafted based on discussion between the group and customer.

Issues to be addressed:
Using SQL to query the database returns the first 'hit' found in the database.  For example, if you search for 'flour', the search will return 'whole wheat flour' because that is the first field containing the word 'flour' encounted when reading the database.  One possible solution is to create a query that returns all relevant hits and lists then in a drop-down from which one can be selected.

week ending October 8 (week 6)

Progress:
Worked on coding to convert ingredients given in ounces.  Completed testing and made corrections to converter function.

Sprint:
In week two of two-week sprint.  Goals for sprint are to complete a GUI.

Progress report for week ending 10/15

We completed most of the tasks listed in the last sprint (ending 10/14).  We now have a working prototype that takes command-line input of ingredients with unit and amount. The conversion function has been completed; nutritional information is now being reported corresponding the amount entered (IE- 1 cup of flour is reported as 1 cup of flour rather than 100 gms of flour).  The app output is a txt file containing the ingredients including amounts and units plus the total nutritional content of the recipe including calories, protein, sodium, fat, and sugar.

Additonal functions added are converter for ingredients added in ounces and a "serving size" function.

The user interface is being developed using Visual Studio but is not yet fully functional.  Currently it has been developed to the point that an ingredient, unit , and amount can be input and the nutritional information from the database will be returned.

The next sprint (ending 10/29) includes continued development of the user interface (this includes conversion of the Python code to C#), a function to save recipes, better formatting of the nutritional label, and extensive testing of the converter function.
