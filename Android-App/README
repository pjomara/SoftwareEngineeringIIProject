This app searches the USDA food database for a user-entered ingredient and returns nutritional information about it.

It uses a Spinner for the units so the user can not enter anything except a usable unit.

It also uses an auto-complete text-bar to help users find the correct ingredient, as well as helping not enter the wrong format 
and help with spelling errors.

It creates a copy of the database in the internal memory of the phone.

When the search button is clicked, it queries the database and stores the nutritional info of the ingredient as a list.

It then passes that info, one at a time, to a new Activity (what you see on the phone at any given time, i.e a new page) 
where it then converts that info into a list view for easier viewing.
