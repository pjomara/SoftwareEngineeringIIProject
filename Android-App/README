This app creates a copy of a database in the internal memory of the phone (Android cannot use just an asset in the folder).

It then opens a connection to the database.

When the search button is clicked, it queries the database and stores the nutritional info as a list.

It then passes that info, one at a time, to a new Activity (what you see on the phone at any given time, i.e a new page) 
where it then converts that info into a list view for easier viewing.
