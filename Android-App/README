Upon starting the app, the Home screen is launched, allowing the user to select a quick search or to make a recipe. (Quick search, as the name implies, is faster and for an ingredient or such.)

Quick Search:
This app searches the USDA food database for a user-entered ingredient and returns nutritional information about it.

It uses a Spinner for the units so the user can not enter anything except a usable unit.

It also uses an auto-complete text-bar to help users find the correct ingredient, as well as helping not enter the wrong format and help with spelling errors.

It creates a copy of the database in the internal memory of the phone.

When the search button is clicked, it queries the database and stores the nutritional info of the ingredient as a list.

It then passes that info, one at a time, to a new Activity (what you see on the phone at any given time, i.e a new page) where it then converts that info into a list view for easier viewing.

Recipe: 
The same as quick search, except:
- Multiple ingredients are added on the spot.
- A recipe name is added.
- The total of the nutrients are passed instead of the individual values.
- unit, amount, and ingredient names are not passed, just the recipe name.

TO BE WORKED ON:
- Ingredients cannot be subtracted, so if you accidentally add one, you have to start over.
- A running list of the ingredients is not kept, meaning you can't view what the ingredient holds after submitting. *** Proabably be the next step to add***
- Currently, the same ListView page is used for both the QuickSearch and Recipe. This means that recipe ingredients aren't listed, instead of just the recipe name it says "no data no data of RecipeName". ***Instead of the same page, a new page will probably be added that will also hold a button to view the ingredients***
- Recipes are not saved.
