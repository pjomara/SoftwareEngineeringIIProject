Weekly customer reports

9/26/2016 (Quantum Rivera)- After being with the developer group Booze Clues, I've noticed their goals and consider them realistic to reach.
            From what we disscussed, I expect them to have a working login page. They emsphasized the importance of users
            and them being able to have acess to their app. For this week, I expect them to have a GUI that shows an actual page
            and some sort of login screen. If they can not reach either goal, I at least expect a prototype GUI that demonstrates
            the vision of their application.
