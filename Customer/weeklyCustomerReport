Weekly customer reports

9/26/2016 (Quantum Rivera)- After being with the developer group Booze Clues, I've noticed their goals and consider them realistic to reach.
            From what we disscussed, I expect them to have a working login page. They emsphasized the importance of users
            and them being able to have acess to their app. For this week, I expect them to have a GUI that shows an actual page
            and some sort of login screen. If they can not reach either goal, I at least expect a prototype GUI that demonstrates
            the vision of their application.

10/05/2016 - The state of the Booze Clues application is good as of now. From what I've been shown, the group as a whole have a clear
             understanding of what needs to be done. They showed me a working prototype, though it was simple as a login screen GUI.
             The login screen brings you into their main page, giving you options for either resturants or bars. The Booze Clues developers
             followed my priorities to perfection, as I requested there be a login and some sort of main page for their application. Certian
             GUI is a work in progress,they showed me a drop down search bar and a click box option for bars and resturatns. For next week,my
             priorities are for the developers of Booze Clues to implement actual locations of bars and resturatns in Plattsburgh. I should be
             able to choose either bars or resturants and have access to what Plattsburgh has to offer in terms of location and name.
