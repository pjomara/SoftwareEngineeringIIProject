Weekly customer reports

9/26/2016 (Quantum Rivera)- After being with the developer group Booze Clues, I've noticed their goals and consider them realistic to reach.
            From what we disscussed, I expect them to have a working login page. They emsphasized the importance of users
            and them being able to have acess to their app. For this week, I expect them to have a GUI that shows an actual page
            and some sort of login screen. If they can not reach either goal, I at least expect a prototype GUI that demonstrates
            the vision of their application.
 
10/05/2016 - The state of the Booze Clues application is good as of now. From what I've been shown, the group as a whole have a clear
             understanding of what needs to be done. They showed me a working prototype, though it was simple as a login screen GUI.
             The login screen brings you into their main page, giving you options for either resturants or bars. The Booze Clues developers
             followed my priorities to perfection, as I requested there be a login and some sort of main page for their application. Certian
             GUI is a work in progress,they showed me a drop down search bar and a click box option for bars and resturatns. For next week,my
             priorities are for the developers of Booze Clues to implement actual locations of bars and resturatns in Plattsburgh. I should be
             able to choose either bars or resturants and have access to what Plattsburgh has to offer in terms of location and name.

10/12/2016 - The state of Booze Clues is stagnating a tiny bit. From what I was told, the programer of the group implemented locations of
             both bars and resturants, which followed my last weeks agenda goals. Unfortunately, the lastest program they showed me 
             wasn't working properly, as it failed show me locations of bars and resturants in Plattsburgh. I can tell by the honesty of the
             programmer that they followed my last weeks agenda as best as possible and said fixing the bug would be an easy task. For next week
             I prioritized they focus on fixing the bug prevent the pop ups on locations, plus add a history database to prevent backtracking.
             A history database would help me with past searches, giving me the ease of returning to a previous location of interest.
